# VEHICLE-IDENTIFIER
In this project we have made a GUI based application which helps 
us to retrieve information of the students whose vehicle number is 
entered in the column.
GUI is based on the code written in java. The data of the students is 
presented in the Database created by us using MySql. The database 
consists of student’s data like their address , phone no. , sap id , 
name and vehicle number etc.
When the data is entered in the column of the GUI it fetches data 
from the Database which is connected to the GUI with the help of 
JDBC (java database connectivity) and displays the data in the 
second Jframe
